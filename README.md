# 🐢 Tide Rescue — A 2.5D Turtle Agent Adventure

**Tide Rescue** is an open-world 2.5D action-adventure RPG made in Unity, developed in just two months by Try2Hard Studios — a multidisciplinary student team at Eindhoven University of Technology.

Step into the shell of **Agent Shell**, a special operative of the IARS (International Animal Rescue Squad), on a mission to rescue the hermit crabs of Shellhaven from the ruthless **Claw Cartel**. With a blend of humor, heart, and heroism, Tide Rescue mixes narrative-driven exploration with lightweight combat in a vivid island world — all from a charming 2.5D perspective.
